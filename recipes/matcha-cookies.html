    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Combine superfine sugar, butter, and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat on medium speed, then increase speed and continue to mix until smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li>Mix in 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, matcha, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until combined. Mix in egg and vanilla, gradually lowering the speed setting until everything is evenly incorporated and you get a dough-like texture. Add chocolate chips and mix in evenly.</li>
    <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool, 5 to 10 minutes more.</li>
